<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General

What are nested loops and how to use them

What is a function and how do you use functions

What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function

What is a prototype

Scope of variables

What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89

What are header files and how to to use them with #include

**Requirements**

General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

More Info

You do not have to understand the call by reference (address), stack, static variables, recursions or arrays, yet.

**Task**

0. isupper

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

1. isdigit

Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2. Collaboration is multiplication

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

3. The numbers speak for themselves

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4. I believe in numbers and signs

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5. Numbers constitute the only universal language

Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch

Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9. Fizz-Buzz

The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

10. Triangles

Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
